Divide and Conquer: Let's Learn Fractions!

Description: Divide & Conquer is an interactive, game-based web application designed to teach fractions to 3rdâ€“5th-grade students. By combining real-world visuals, engaging activities, and instant feedback, students can overcome their fear of fractions while having fun. It's perfect for teachers looking to integrate interactive tools into their classrooms and for parents wanting to support learning at home.
User Story:

Target Audience:

3rd to 5th-grade students who are just beginning to learn about fractions, as well as teachers and parents who are looking for engaging resources to help young learners understand fractions.
Goal: To create an interactive, engaging, and easy-to-understand experience for students learning the basics of fractions, helping them overcome any fear or confusion about the topic while making math fun and relatable.

User Experience:

*  As a student, I want to learn about fractions in a way that feels like a game so that I can understand and enjoy math without feeling overwhelmed. I want to see fractions visually, like slices of pizza or pieces of a chocolate bar, because it helps me understand what fractions represent in real life. I also want to try solving problems on my own and get feedback right away, so I know if I'm doing it right.

*  As a teacher, I want a resource that is interactive and easy to use in my classroom. It should help me explain the concepts of fractions visually and include hands-on activities that make it easier for my students to grasp the topic. I want to be able to track my students' progress and identify who needs more help, so I can give individual attention where it's needed.

*  As a parent, I want my child to have access to a fun online resource that reinforces what they're learning at school. I want to see my child excited about math and to be able to work with them on activities that don't feel like "homework," but still help them improve their understanding of fractions.

Features:

*  Interactive Visuals: Visual representation of fractions using familiar items (pizza, chocolate bars, etc.).
*  Game-Like Activities: Drag-and-drop, multiple-choice questions, and shaded diagram interactions.
*  Progress Tracking: Saves progress using local storage to motivate students and track accomplishments.
*  Immediate Feedback: Students get real-time feedback to guide their learning.
*  Engaging Tone: Fun and encouraging messages make math approachable and exciting.

Success Criteria:

*  There is a landing page and four lesson/activity pages created.
*  The landing page will clearly explain the purpose and content of the project, guiding users to the correct lessons. The landing page will also track user progress toward their goals.
*  Students demonstrate improved understanding of basic fractions. This will be measured by pre- and post-assessment scores to show progress. (Maybe?)
*  Each lesson page will include a lesson and an interactive activity that reinforces the concept being taught. Each activity will provide instant feedback to help students understand the material.
